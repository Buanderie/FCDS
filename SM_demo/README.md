#### Known issue
Boards made before November of 2018 has a well known issue. It happens only on a very rare occasion, mostly with a bit-banged host controller or in a noisy environment. If you experience any hang-ups, lock-ups, freezes on the readings please let me know. Latest boards are **not** effected anymore.
